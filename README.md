# Gameboy-Discord
Using a Gameboy emulator and making it into a Discord bot !

Im not the best at doing this, and i suck at coding so its completely understandable if you complain how slow this runs.
I made this bot with my friend RedCommand.

# How to run
Open command prompt in the folder directory and install these two packages ```discord.py``` and ```pyboy```, after that you can just replace the String in ```main.py``` line 94 with your Discord bot token, and run the bot with ```python main.py```

# Commads
```gb start``` Start the emulator with the attached Gameboy rom file  
```gb stop``` Stop the currently running emulator  
```gb emotes``` Shows the emojis used  
```gb use``` Enables the input system, might change  
To input control after using the ```gb use``` command, you use the ```do``` command followed by the button you wanna press, here are the buttons:  
```do a``` press A  
```do s``` press B  
```do t``` press SELECT  
```do f``` press START  
```do u``` press UP  
```do d``` press DOWN  
```do l``` press LEFT  
```do r``` press RIGHT
