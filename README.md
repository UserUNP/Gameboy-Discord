# Gameboy-Discord
Using a Gameboy emulator and making it into a Discord bot !

Im not the best at doing this, and i suck at coding so its completely understandable if you complain how slow this runs.
this might be my first actual Discord bot.

# How to run
Open command prompt in the folder directory and install these two packages ```discord.py``` and ```pyboy```, after that you can just replace the String in ```main.py``` line 94 with your Discord bot token, and run the bot with ```python main.py```
